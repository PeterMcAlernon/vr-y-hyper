				<h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
				<p>Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds. By simulating as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell, the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world. In Virtual Reality, the computer uses similar sensors and maths.
the position of the user’s eyes are located within the simulated environment. If the user’s head turns, the graphics react accordingly
VR technology creates a convincing, interactive world for the user

				<h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
				<p>Augmented Reality simulates artificial objects in the real environment; Virtual Reality creates an artificial environment to inhabit.
In Augmented Reality, the computer uses sensors and algorithms to determine the position and orientation of a camera. AR technology then renders the 3D graphics as they would appear from the viewpoint of the camera, superimposing the computer-generated images over a user’s view of the real world.
